Hi,


this will be a virtual archive filesystem for IBM Spectrum Archive LE. 
Spectrum Archive LE is a free product but there are lot's of limitations. With this program, you 
will be able to eliminate volser folders and you can create as many different "archive domains"
as you want. Each archive domain is a virtual filesystem and each archive domain can have 
it's own duplication policy.

Currently the system is in development stage: for now, you have to copy the files to the tapes
manually but after that, the system can go through the tapes and create virtual filesystem 
entries into a MySQL/MariaDB database.

Planned parts:
- Appserver - this repo
- Node.js / Vue webpage with authentication
- CLI
- Fuse FS

APPSERVER INSTALLATION

- User empty_db.sql to create the database structure in MariaDB. The system is tested on CentOS Stream release 8
